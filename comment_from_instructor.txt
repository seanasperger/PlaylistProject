COMMENTS FROM THE INSTRUCTOR:

This is a good-looking project, Sean, and I'm glad you finally got it
uploaded as a repository on GitHub.

As you know, we wanted to see more than one commit on here, but at 
least you got the .gitignore file set up on there, so you've got 
that going for you! :)

This project is a nice summary of how you can have: 

1. a class that represents something (like a song)
2. a class that manages an Array or Array list of those items, and
3. a Runner or Tester that creates the manager and demonstrates how
   it works.

Classic! Keep up the good work!

SCORE:19/20
